# RapidSum
RapidSum is an open-source project that simplifies the process of summarizing articles. It takes URLs of articles as input and utilizes the power of the RapidAPI Articles Extractor and Summarizer to generate clear and concise summaries. This project was built using a combination of modern web technologies, including TailwindCSS, @reduxjs/toolkit, Material UI, and RapidAPI.

## How it works
1. Enter the URL of the article you want to summarize.
2. RapidSum makes a request to the RapidAPI Articles Extractor and Summarizer API.
3. The API returns a summarized version of the article.
4. The summarized article is displayed, allowing users to quickly grasp the main points without having to read the entire article.

## Technologies Used
1. TailwindCSS: A utility-first CSS framework for building modern web interfaces.
2. @reduxjs/toolkit: A powerful toolset for efficient Redux development.
3. Material UI: A popular UI library for React applications, providing pre-built components and styles.
4. RapidAPI: An API marketplace that provides access to a wide range of APIs, including the Articles Extractor and Summarizer API used in this project.

## Usage
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/SmeetChavan/RapidSum.git
2. Install dependencies: npm install
3. Set up your RapidAPI key and store it in the .env file.
4. Start the development server: npm run dev
5. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5173 to access RapidSum.
